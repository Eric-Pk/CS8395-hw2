# Generative AI Python Coding Problem Generator and Tester

## Project Overview

This project aims to generate Python coding problems and automatically test generated solutions using a Python script. The generated problems are stored in a JSON file, and the script uses a placeholder solution function to simulate the solution generation process. The goal is to create an automated testing framework that can evaluate generative AI's coding abilities.

## Installation

No installation is required to run the script. Simply download the Python script (`python_autotest_script.py`) and ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Place the `python_coding_problems.json` file in the same directory as the script.

2. Run the script using the following command:

   ```
   python python_autotest_script.py
   ```

3. The script will load the problems from the JSON file, generate placeholder solutions, test the solutions, and generate a report on the results.

## File Structure

- `python_autotest_script.py`: The main Python script that generates and tests solutions.
- `python_coding_problems.json`: A JSON file containing the generated Python coding problems.
